						<p>I’m tired of this life</p>
						<p>I’m tired of hoping</p>
						<p>I’m tired of praying</p>
						<p>I’m tired of holding it in</p>
						<p>I’m tired of my struggles</p>
						<p>I’m tired of feeling trapped</p>
						<p>I’m tired of feeling helpless</p>
						<p>I’m tired of saying "I'm okay"</p>
						<p>I’m tired of explaining myself</p>
						<p>I’m tired of my responsibilities</p>
						<p>I’m tired of not wanting to talk</p>
						<p>I’m tired of being misunderstood</p>
						<p>I’m tired of not being able to talk</p>
						<p>I’m tired of putting on a brave face</p>
						<p>I’m tired of barely keeping myself afloat</p>
						<p>I’m tired of not being the best version of myself</p>
						<p>I’m tired of trying to be the best version of myself</p>
						<p>I’m tired of believing things will eventually get better</p>
						<p>I’m tired of being tired</p>
