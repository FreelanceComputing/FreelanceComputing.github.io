      "content"	 : "                    Before concluding this series, I’d like to highlight a few difficulties which have prevented me from making the most out of this system. Unfortunately, I had to learn the hard way as I fumbled my way through. I hope that by sharing my experience below, you’ll have the head start that I never had.                    Any time that I forgot to perform an appraisal at the end of the day and write down what the schedule for the following day needed to look like, the next day always ended up being less productive than the former. This was one of the lessons which I had to learn in the early days. Because this system was not yet routine for me, when I woke up the next day, I’d constantly have to go back to the schedule I’d written down the previous night so that I could find out what I needed to be doing at that time of the day. Later in the day as I settled in to work on my own projects, I’d waste precious time, sometimes up to an hour, trying to figure out where I left off the previous day and what tasks I needed to get on with. At the time, I didn’t see anything wrong at all. I believed that I was keeping busy – cross-checking details of the schedule, figuring out what tasks to accomplish, etc. In retrospect, I realise that I was being busy but not necessarily being productive.                    Another stumbling block for me was not knowing when to let go of a problem and revisit it later; and one year down the line, I still struggle with it. This often happens when trying to fix a bug in a computer program. I can easily spend thrice the scheduled time at my desk, poking and prodding and trying to resolve the issue. It quickly became clear that this attitude would seriously upset my schedule – starting with the fact that I would skip the scheduled retrospective for that day, followed by me going to bed at 2 am in the morning. This would create a domino effect that would make the next day even less productive. Having realised this, I started disciplining myself to keep a backlog where I could record any pertinent bugs and get back to them the next day.I use this system to manage multiple projects and one weakness I’ve observed is how my mind often wanders off to think about one project while working on another. For example, I may have planned to add a certain feature to a mobile App but instead of concentrating on this task, I would find myself digging my brains for a solution on how to resolve a bug on the website I was working on the other day. It goes without saying, but I’ve had to actively discipline my mind to concentrate on the task at hand instead of letting it wander off.One last point worth mentioning to help you concentrate is to put your phone on airplane mode. Most phone calls and text messages can probably wait a couple of hours and do not require an urgent response.. . .                     My Schedule                     6:30 am –  6:45 am.

      "content"	 : "                    Ever wondered why some people seem to have more than 24 hours in a day? They are simply good stewards of time. They utilise every spare minute of their day to do something productive. One way to achieve this is to have a daily schedule. As explained in part 2 of this series, my system relies on scheduling whatever time I get outside of work. At the end of this series I will share my personal schedule.                    For now, we shall be working with an alternative schedule based on the one-hour train commute presented in part 2.6:00 am – 6:30 am. Rise and shine.6:30 am – 7:30 am. House chores. Social media.7:30 am – 8:00 am. Shower and get dressed for work.8:00 am – 9:00 am. Commute to work. Breakfast on-the-go.5:00 pm – 6:00 pm. Commute from work.6:00 pm – 7:00 pm. Feed the body.7:00 pm – 8:00 pm. Recreation time.8:00 pm – 10:00pm. Personal project.10:00pm – 10:30 pm. Daily appraisal.10:30pm. Sleep tight.                    Based on the above schedule, there are at least 4 hours every day which can be used to work on your own project. This sums up to a whopping 20 hours a week – based on a five-day work week and excluding weekends. In my case, the numbers are only slightly higher due to my almost non-existent commute. Before addressing the rest of the schedule, I’d like to draw your attention to the following three activities: rise and shine, personal project and daily appraisal. No matter how you tailor the schedule to suit you, ensure that you make adequate time for each of these.6:00 am – 6:30 am. As a Christian, I use this time to pray and listen to a podcast where a priest celebrates the Mass daily. Making use of this time is not exclusive to those who pray. The purpose is to clear your mind and prepare yourself for the day ahead. This can involve meditation or simply going out for a walk. Immediately when you wake up, avoid checking emails or social media and go straight into your alone time. getting alone time can be even trickier for people living as a couple or with kids. But try to schedule this alone time before you get started on your daily activities.6:30 am – 7:30 am. This slot is very flexible. However, I recommend doing chores such as making your bed, tidying your house, and so on – leaving you free to do more important things in the evening. During this time, feel free to check and update your social media accounts i.e. once you’ve given your alone time its due.                    8:00 am – 9:00 am and 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm. Use your commute to and from work to check emails, make phone calls, brainstorm, develop ideas and do market research pertaining to your personal projects. Do not check work emails as you’ll have plenty of time between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm to do so. Dedicate this time to building your own business.                    8:00 pm – 10:00pm. Dedicate this time purely to working on your own project, be it writing a book or building an e-commerce venture or developing an App or whatever it is that you are working towards. Two hours of uninterrupted time in the evenings is ideal for this.                    10:00pm – 10:30 pm. During this time, take stock of your day. This can be as simple as asking questions like: ‘what have I achieved today?’, ‘what do I need to accomplish tomorrow?’, etc. This process is very important because it puts things into perspective. It helps you to see more clearly whether you are biting off way more than you can chew or not biting enough. Use this time to plan project-related activities for the next day. For example, write down a list of people to email and call, points to research during your commute, tasks to accomplish in the evening, and so on. In this way you will spend more of the following day getting stuff done rather than planning what needs to be done.                    ",

      "content"	 : "                    The most important requirement for getting the best out of this system is living as close to work as possible. Since it relies on scheduling whatever time you get outside of work, it is important to bring your commute down to a minimum.                    My own commute is a mere 10 minutes; I recognise that this is a luxury which most people cannot afford, but I would encourage you to live not more than 45 minutes away from your work-place if possible. If you can afford to spend slightly more on your accommodation so that you can live closer to work, then consider it an investment for the future. After all, once you become fully autonomous, you can live anywhere you wish.                    If you are unable to cut down on your commute, one approach is to ditch driving to work and use public transport. You can then spend that transit time working on your own projects. For example, a one-hour commute might involve walking ten minutes to the train station near your home, spending forty-five minutes on the train, and then walking another five minutes to the office. It is clear from this example that an hour and a half each day can be spent constructively while in transit. In the event where driving to work is indispensable, you can make better use of your commute by doing something productive like listening to podcasts or learning a language while driving.                    The next requirement is discipline. Even if you come up with a system that works perfectly for you, you need to be disciplined enough to stick with it. You also need to be disciplined with your recreational activities. This may involve rearranging your other commitments such as hanging out at the pub with friends or catching up on your favourite TV show or playing video games etc.                    The final prerequisite is a monthly calendar. The calendar should ideally be a physical one which can be hung on your bedroom wall or on your fridge or somewhere prominent within your home where you can easily see it. Each page of the calendar should cover an entire month with the days laid out on a grid. The purpose of this is to help you form a habit. Each day that you stick to your schedule to the letter, you should mark a cross on the calendar. The more crosses you see on the calendar as you walk past it, the more incentive you will have to keep following the schedule. You can get rid of the calendar after you have successfully followed the schedule for two consecutive months. Of course, this will only work if you are completely honest with yourself.                    Another thing that can help is sharing your schedule with a close friend or family member. You can ask them to check on you occasionally to find out if you’re on the right track.                    ",

      "content"	 : "The mysteries of the resurrection and ascension are fascinating to say the least and although these events have a lot of religious and spiritual significance, I would like to approach them from a modern day perspective. I’m not talking about people like Mr. Quiboloy from the Philippines who claims to be the ‘Son of God’ while taking money from millions of poor people in order to fund his ministry. Neither am I talking about any renown preacher, minister or priest for that matter. I’m talking about an almost invisible person from your neighbourhood who suddenly becomes the talk of the town.Take for example a park in your neighbourhood where people tend to hangout. Each time you go for a walk, you notice a small group of people — say less than ten — gathered around a woman who is narrating a story of some kind. One day your curiosity gets the better of you, so you decide to stop and see for yourself what is going on. After a few inquiries you are told that this person is a gifted storyteller and orator and apparently has a knack for predicting what will be the exact outcome of any situation that you may be unsure about in your life.Naturally you are sceptical about these rumours but also a little bit curious because after listening to one of her narratives, you admit to yourself that she is indeed very gifted. As you are about to leave, you hear one of the men in the group asking for the outcome of a certain doctor’s appointment, to discuss the meaning of some x-ray results which were taken a few weeks ago, following a bout of chronic coughing. Now you’re thinking to yourself that the man probably just has some kind of chest infection but you realise that he is a neighbour of yours so you decide to stick around and listen to what the prediction will be.The woman’s prediction is that the x-rays will show some sort of inoperable lung tumour and that he will die by the end of the week. Some of the other people gathered around the woman begin to panic and are worried about him but you just laugh this off and tell him that he’ll be fine. The woman responds by saying that he’ll be more than fine because on the day of his funeral, he will rise from his coffin and float into the skies to the place where he truly belongs. At this point everyone is laughing hysterically because they all assume that she’s joking. You simply think she’s gone bonkers.Sure enough as the week goes by, the prediction comes to pass. Resulting in a media uproar that leaves the masses in utter disbelief.One can only imagine the conspiracy theories being used in order to disprove what happened. This will definitely be a case of seeing is not believing as even those who were at the funeral will accuse their eyes of betraying them. Those who prepared the body for burial will probably swear that the morgue drawers had an uncanny resemblance to incubators. What about you? Were you not there when the prediction was made? Did you not laugh it off as the rantings of a mad woman? Yet you don’t believe what’s going on.What’s going through your mind? The man had never been a popular person, in fact you didn’t know him well enough. Now you’re wondering if he was some sort of genius who was not only able to fake his own death but who was rich enough or resourceful enough to acquire an incredibly tiny, silent, powerful jetpack which he used to launch himself into the clouds. But then if he masterminded all of it, did this imply that the storyteller was in on it as well? What about the doctor’s diagnosis? Surely he can’t just stay in the sky for good, right? Where did he go off to? Is there going to be some quest for his missing body? And the questions go on and on.Obviously none of the people who witnessed these events are satisfied by what their eyes have seen. They’re all looking for an alternative explanation. A loophole, maybe. Though far-fetched, this fictional story demonstrates that nowadays we are more keen to question what our own senses experience — and this is a good thing because it has led to various scientific discoveries. However, matters of Faith stretch beyond sight, smell, hearing, touch and taste.Some might say that the people whom Jesus appeared to after He rose from the dead and those who witnessed His ascension were so desperate for a happy ending that their minds started playing tricks on them or they chose not to question whatever it is that they witnessed. My view is that ‘enlightened’ as we may be, we have been robbed of our sense of wonder and awe; making us more cynical and less attuned to anything beyond our five senses. As William Wordsworth once wrote1: ‘Little we see in nature that is ours; … For this, for everything, we are out of tune; … It moves us not — Great God!’*1Barber, L. (2008).

      "content"	 : "                    In this series, I will be sharing a system which I have developed to help me transition to a point where I can become fully self-employed. I am nowhere near that point yet, but it is a work in progress which I suspect will take a few years.                    From a very young age, running my own business has always appealed to me more than working for someone else. This inclination most likely stems from the fact that both of my parents are entrepreneurs. Having spent a few years working for a company, it has quickly become apparent that this isn’t for me. This has incited a frantic search for information on how to become a successful entrepreneur. One recurring theme was having to quit your 9-5 job in order to dedicate more time to your business. In my case, I neither have a viable business idea nor enough money saved up to warrant taking such a risk. But this hasn’t discouraged me.                    I am naturally industrious, and I believe that I have what it takes to excel as an entrepreneur. One key quality required to be successfully self-employed is ‘grit’. That is, a perseverance of effort combined with a strong determination to overcome the challenges that you will face as you try to achieve whatever you are passionate about. Let’s break these down.Perseverance of effort: that is, continuous attempts to achieve something despite difficultiesStrong determination: a resolute intention to achieve a desired goalPassion: an intense feeling toward something, someone or even an idea or a concept                    Ask yourself if you possess these qualities; based on my research, it will give you a clue as to whether you are cut out for the entrepreneurial way of life. Even if you can’t relate to this or are unwilling to become self-employed, hopefully this series can still help you develop a side-hustle which may then flourish into a secondary source of income.Here’s what I’ve achieved since I started on this journey: I successfully developed my very first mobile app and I’ve started developing a second one. I’ve designed 2 websites, written 24 articles and poems, 5 of which have been published in magazines, ran my first ever pop-up shop with a 72 per cent profit margin and I’m currently running a second shop. In less than a year of following this system, I have made roughly £1000 on the side and I am positive that in a few more years this figure will grow to a point where I can become self-sufficient.In part 2 of this series, I shall cover what is required to get the most out of my system. In part 3, I shall lay out my system and how it can be modified to suit you. In the final part of this series, I will address potential pitfalls that you may come across and how to get around them.                    ",

	{
      "content"	 : "                    One of the remarkable things about Catholic churches is their use of paintings and carvings to create an atmosphere of reverence and awe. It is not uncommon to find a worshipper kneeling down, gaze transfixed by the carving of Christ on a crucifix hanging above the altar, while another weeps at the feet of a statue of the virgin Mary, asking her to intercede on their behalf.                    Being a Catholic myself, I am very much accustomed to such sights. However, I cannot help but wonder whether this is some type of idol worship – which is strictly forbidden by the second commandment in the book of Exodus 20:4-5a as follows: “You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them;”.                    The usual excuses given by Catholic priests when confronted with this clear violation of God’s law are not convincing enough for me. No matter what bible translation is used, these verses remain unambiguous - leaving no room for multiple interpretations.                    I am not a theologian by any means but I believe that making any sort of likeness of the divine is a form of blasphemy, for no human being can claim to capture the essence of God or of the saviour Jesus Christ. In the case of other biblical saints, such as the virgin Mary, who died long before any carvings of them were created, whatever adorns our church buildings today are simply figments of the artist’s imagination – a false depiction of the saints they claim to represent. There is obviously an exception for more modern-day saints. Although the question still remains as to whether or not these statues should be in our places of worship. I don’t think they should.                    Some might argue that apart from their decorative effect, these carvings are simply tools which help to bring the reality of God closer to us, while others may assert that it is like hanging on to a picture of a loved one as a reminder of how much they mean to us. This doesn’t hold true for God whose essence cannot be captured by a statue or a painting because it is present all around us, in nature, and in the people we come across. The picture of a loved one is more or less a true likeness of that person, whom we have an actual memory of because we have seen them face to face and dwelt in their presence. The same cannot be said of God or of the saviour Jesus Christ or any of the biblical saints.In favour of the practice, one priest cited  the bronze snake which God ordered Moses to make for the Israelites, so that anyone bitten by fiery serpents in the desert could look upon it and be healed. But the brazen serpent wasn’t meant to be replicated and placed in synagogues so that people could bow before it and pray to it. The Israelites weren’t meant to use it as means to bring God closer to them. In fact, God was already in their midst but they grumbled against God and Moses. Because of this they were punished with deadly bites from fiery snakes. The bronze snake carved by Moses was strictly a form of healing from snake bites.As a matter of fact, the brazen serpent was destroyed 700 years later by the king Hezekiah as explained in the second book of the Kings 18:4b: “He broke into pieces the bronze snake Moses had made, for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it. (It was called Nehushtan).”.In the same way that the brazen serpent - which was intended to heal – became a kind of god to the Jews, so have the decorative carvings and paintings become a kind of idol to certain Catholic Christians. Some Catholics have become so dependent on them that they believe their prayers are more effective when kneeling before one of these statues. Surely true worship can be done anywhere as long as it comes from a broken and contrite heart. Anyone who thinks otherwise needs to re-evaluate their spiritual life.Following from the above, I think the Catholic church needs to get rid of this age-old tradition, so that the practices of its faithful may be brought more in line with God’s laws.

      "content"	 : "                    Being a woman in her mid-twenties, I am at that point in life where marriage tends to come up in my conversations with family and friends. They feel that at this stage in life where I am highly educated and have a well-paid job, the next milestone I should be looking to achieve is that of marriage.                    When I tell them not to hold their breath, they seem appalled. In their opinion, I am not taking this issue seriously enough. I should invest more time and effort into achieving this milestone before it becomes too late; before I become one of those women in their mid-thirties with no husband and no children.                    While I do want to get married and have one or two children of my own, I am in no hurry to get there. I am still trying to find my purpose in life and I believe that there is more to my life than becoming someone’s wife. All my extra time is spent working on various projects which I believe will eventually lead me to discover and achieve my mission on this planet; leaving me with little time to present myself as ‘wife material’. Putting myself out there – going to different social outings where there are likely to be single men – requires time and effort. And even if I meet someone ‘interesting’, that whole process of getting to know them, going out on dates, requires even more time and effort.                    I, like many others, would like to lead a happy and successful life. But happiness and success mean different things to different people. Most people in the African community believe that simply being married with children is the pinnacle of a woman’s success. This is not the case for me; it is being happily married to someone who is striving to be the best version of himself and who pushes me to do the same.                    I have so many goals and ambitions and so little time and resources to bring them to fruition. I don’t want to invest time and energy trying to merge paths with someone else while still trying to discover what my own path in life is. For all I know, this person I meet may not even know what theirs is. We may then end up in a situation where, two people who haven’t discovered their individual purpose are trying to merge paths in order to form a single purpose. It becomes a case of the blind leading the blind.                    If I am not in control of the direction in which my life is going, I run the risk of losing my sense of self by being involved in a romantic relationship. I use the term ‘control’ here very loosely because none of us is in absolute control of our lives. Being conscious of this, I think it makes sense for me to invest time and effort in getting to a stage where I can say, ‘I know what my purpose is.’.                    One of my great fears about marriage is being unequally yoked. That is, being paired with someone who doesn’t match my drive, or my spiritual beliefs, or my sense of purpose and ambition. Hopefully the closer I get to discovering my purpose, the easier it will be to determine what I want in a husband, besides the obvious criteria of being loving and kind.That being said, I am in no way a recluse. I still go to a few parties and social gatherings. However, if I can get away with it, I will always prioritise spending more time on my personal projects over being a socialite. Hopefully I won’t be writing another article in ten years’ time expressing how much I regret not having invested enough time in finding a husband.",

    "2018-06-04-victim-blaming": 
	{
      "content"	 : "                    Victim blaming can be described as a phenomenon where the casualty of a wrongful act is somehow held responsible for the hurt inflicted on them. This occurrence seems to be prevalent in cases of sexual and physical assault where the perpetrator is a man and the victim is a woman.                    When women report cases of domestic abuse to their family and friends, the first question that they are often faced with is, “What did you do to provoke him?”. As if that is enough reason for a man to physically assault his wife. Unfortunately, I have been one of those who ask that question. This is especially typical in communities where women are expected to be subservient to their spouses and men are given free rein to discipline recalcitrant wives.                    Some people’s reactions to reports of sexual assault are similarly appalling. Not only do they blame the woman for dressing in an overtly revealing way but they also blame her for behaving in a provocative way and intentionally seducing her rapist. By their logic, the rapist was powerless in the face of such seduction and had no choice but to force himself on the woman. I wonder what excuse will be given to women who, despite wearing full body coverings such as the Burka, still become victims of rape.                    When it comes to married couples, others believe that consent is not required because the man is simply exercising his right as a spouse. When faced with these kinds of criticism from their entourage, it is no wonder that many women shy away from reporting these incidents to the authorities.Such perceptions have a negative effect on victims and perpetrators. In cases of repeated abuse, victims may start believing their critics and begin blaming themselves for their misfortunes at the hands of their abuser. Perpetrators also face the danger of hindering their own rehabilitation process because in their eyes their actions have been validated by the fact that other people are blaming the victim. As a result of this, they genuinely do not see any wrongdoing on their part and are unable, or even unwilling, to take responsibility for their actions.                    Society plays a huge part in perpetuating this vicious cycle. As more children grow up in homes where abuse is rife, girls learn to accept such behaviour from their future partners and boys develop an attitude of nonchalance towards cases of abuse, if they themselves do not become abusers. Girls can also suffer from a lack of self-confidence when interacting with the opposite sex as they fret over their clothing being too revealing or their actions being too provocative.                    Nobody blames robbery victims for not having taken the necessary precautions to keep the robbers at bay. Neither are kidnap victims blamed for finding themselves in a location where they could be easily abducted. So why do we place this additional yoke on the necks of women who have been sexually or physically abused?",

    "2018-05-07-transitioning-from-relaxed-hair-to-natural-hair": 
	{
      "content"	 : "                    ‘Relaxed hair’ is a term employed widely throughout the African community to indicate hair which has been permanently straightened by means of a chemical product also known as a hair relaxer. Whereas ‘natural hair’ refers to hair that has not been permanently straightened.                    At my hair salon not long ago, I was asked why I decided to go natural - what was it that made me forgo relaxed hair, which is relatively easier to manage. I thought of saying that it was because I wanted healthier hair, or that I wanted my African roots on full display. Neither would have been entirely true on their own. What really inspired me was the natural hair movement that was in spring, which combined the two. I wanted in.                    Before deciding to make this transition, my relaxed hair was about thirteen inches long and for someone who had sported short hair through their teenage years, this was a big deal. Once I left university, several years ago now, I discovered the fledgling movement in the USA. This involved pictures and videos of African-American women chopping off their relaxed hair in defiance to the Western ideal that straight, sleek hair is better than the alternative; an idea that they too may have once subscribed to. Most importantly, they were embracing their natural God-given hair and encouraging other black women to do the same. While I found this movement very fascinating and sympathised with their cause, I couldn’t bring myself to shave off my hair for two reasons.                    To explain the first one, let me take you back to my school days where school rules and regulations required every student to have a shaved head. Meaning that I was practically bald for at about seven years. Later on then, as my hair grew to shoulder length, it is no surprise that I was reluctant to let go of all that progress and return to ground zero.                    Secondly, when I was in primary school my natural hair was such a chore to manage because there wasn’t enough information at that time about how to deal with natural hair. Most hairdressers would just end up relaxing your hair according to their training. My mum however was adamant—she would not allow her children’s hair to be contaminated with the harsh chemicals in hair relaxers. It didn’t matter how much I pleaded with her. I had two options: either to cut off the hair completely, or deal with the incompetence of my local hairdressers. I opted for the latter, which meant many painful tears at the hair salon. Naturally I looked forward to becoming an adult so that I could have the sleek, pain-free hair I’d always dreamed of. Although I admired the courageous ladies who were shaving off their hair online, I balked at the idea of going back to the struggle of my preteens.                    As the natural hair movement gained traction, some companies took advantage of its spring to start marketing hair products which catered specifically to kinky, curly hair - as is often the state of natural hair. It wasn’t long before these particular products were as commonplace as the chemical hair straightening ones in your local Afro-hair shop. There also developed a knowledge pool of what products worked best for people with different curl patterns and hair porosity levels.                    Armed with this new knowledge and the wealth of new hair products to choose from, I had no doubt that managing my natural hair wouldn’t be a painful exercise and I was spoiled for choice when I needed to buy the right products for my hair. It just so happened that at about this time my younger sister had begun growing an afro and her hair looked healthy and luscious. Everything was urging me to take the plunge, or the chop.                    Because I didn’t want to shave off all my hair again, I decided to wait until I had a few months of new growth before cutting off what was left of my relaxed ends. The whole exercise was fairly painless, except for the sadness I felt at having to let all that hair go. Thankfully, this was soon superseded by the enjoyment that I found in looking after my hair. It was growing quicker than I ever remembered and it was very thick. Due to its unique texture, it was fertile ground for a variety of hairstyles. I took full advantage of this and my colleagues almost couldn’t recognise me every Monday morning as I turned up with a different hairstyle each time.                    Predictably, the road hasn’t been easy, time and money having been the two biggest obstacles. I have spent countless hours researching hair products and finding a care routine that best fits me, which has involved plenty of purchases as I sifted through what did and didn’t work.                    With these matters sorted, I put more time into finding an adequate hair salon that could put my routine into practice. Of course this was more costly than doing it all by myself, but it would also take twice as much time, and one hundred percent more energy.                    To this day I am still enjoying my hair’s natural beauty, so much so that I don’t feel like I need to have it permanently straightened again. Three years in, I haven’t even had to flat-iron it. To those who’re still on fence about taking the natural route—if my own experience is anything to go by, you’ll be happier for it. But do some research first, considering your own personal needs. Happy chopping!",

    "2018-04-23-the-adventures-of-jolly-tippler": 
	{
      "content"	 : "                    Having sat down at one of the Poker tables with his friends, Jolly Tippler noticed a very beautiful woman across the hall. She was a cocktail girl, dressed in an eye-catching bunny outfit, serving at the roulette table adjacent to him. She had very thick black hair, bright almond shaped eyes and full lips. Jolly sorely wished that he had been playing roulette that day instead of Poker.                    He remembered however, that he had never had a winning streak at chance games and had lost a considerable amount of money at slot machines and other such games. Poker, he mused, was also a game of probabilities; but at least, he was competing against his friends and not the house. Jolly fancied himself to be a quick-witted man with a sharp mathematical mind. Over the years he had developed his Poker skills and he hoped to make a fortune by the end of the night. More importantly, he hoped to win over the affections of the beautiful cocktail girl serving at the roulette table.                    Unfortunately, Jolly had never been good at flirting with women. He was a lonely man and had never taken a woman out on a date. He never seemed to have enough courage, never seemed to have the right words. But this time, he was determined. He had already won a few rounds of Poker and he was feeling especially lucky. This was love at first sight and he was prepared to do whatever he could to sweep her off her feet. He tried catching her eye and flagging her down to order a drink. He knew a strong drink or two would help; of that, he was certain. While he tried and failed to get her attention, he heard a soft voice next to him asking if he needed anything to drink.                    As he looked up above his shoulder, his eyes rested upon another bunny clad lass. She had a slender neck, rosy cheeks and a sweet smile, but suffered from a squint.  One of her eyes looked to the left, the other looked straight at him. She went by the name of Keeloosh and said she’d be happy to help. Jolly was repulsed by this cross-eyed girl but ordered a drink from her, for he needed to summon the courage to tackle the task at hand.                    He sipped his drink while playing and ordered another glass each time he won a round. By the third glass his tie was loose, his confidence had grown, his vision started blurring out and he knew it was time to make his move. He rose from the table, leaving his winning chips behind. Walking over and stumbling, but pressing on all the same, he made his way to the roulette table. He introduced himself to her once he was within earshot and asked what name she went by. She said she was Amandeudoos and asked if he would care for a drink. Of course, he did. He smiled ingenuously and marvelled at his luck. By the sixth drink he asked her if she would dance with him and by the ninth he asked if she would marry him.                    The next thing he remembered, he was tying the knot and after the preacher’s blessing, he swept her up into his arms. He staggered out and almost fell but steadied himself on. Swelling with pride while carrying his bride into their wedding suite, he placed her eagerly on the bed and made his way to the bathroom to sober himself up. Splashing cold water on his face to clear the drunken fog, he heard a soft voice calling out to him and he hastened to the bedroom. There laying down upon the bed, just as he’d left her, was his newly wedded bride in her wedding apparel. He went over to lift her veil, and oh! to his dismay - gone was the mane of thick black hair and bright almond shaped eyes. Though she had a rosy cheek and the sweetest smile, she suffered from a squint. One of her eyes looked to the left while the other winked at him.",

    "2018-04-09-oh-no-there-goes-the-eye-candy": 
	{
      "content"	 : "                    I observed an interesting occurrence at work a few years ago which got me thinking about dress code etiquette in the corporate environment and what might or might not be considered appropriate work wear.                    As I was walking back to my desk from our breakout room, I observed that one of my co-workers, a new employee whom I had never had a chance to speak to before, had her dress hitched dangerously high up her thigh. When I use the term ‘dangerously’, I mean that it was hitched high enough for me to know she was wearing hold-ups and not tights. She was bent over another associate’s desk, a woman as well, while going over some paper work. I immediately thought to myself that this would be a good opportunity to make contact and speak to her. As I was making my way to where she was crouched I had another thought at the back of my mind; has anyone else noticed this? And if so why hadn’t they approached her to let her know? A little background on my office dynamic - women represent less than ten percent of the workforce.                    After apologising for interrupting them and introducing myself, I brought up the issue as casually as possible amid the little chit chat that ensued. “Oh! Thank you ever so much.”, she exclaimed while pulling the dress down. “I hadn’t realised what was going on with my dress”. I walked away feeling good about myself for having approached her and having addressed the issue in a seemingly non-aggravating way.                    As I sat at my desk musing about my accomplishments, the lady in question happened to be going back to her desk and we shared a complicit smile. But as she walked past me, I noticed something else. That dress was shockingly short. I was instantly dismayed. I couldn’t help but wonder why anyone would wear anything so short to the work place. Then again, I berated myself for mentally judging her outfit and decided to concentrate on the fact that she’d seemed to appreciate me warning her about the dress. Furthermore, it was a very nice dress and she looked gorgeous in it. So I brushed it aside.                    A week or so later, I noticed a male colleague staring intently at something a few paces ahead. As I moved my head around my monitor to see what had gripped his interest so much, I observed the same lady standing and talking to someone else with her back to me. I could see her bra clearly through her flimsy top. I had no doubt that this is what had arrested my fellow co-worker’s attention.                    Upon seeing this, I felt so uncomfortable for her. But then it occurred to me that I had no reason to. She was obviously conscious of the fact that the top was transparent and comfortable enough to wear it to the office. After this incident, I started noticing more and more that this lady was in the habit of wearing such revealing clothes. For the most part it made me feel self-conscious and I know for a fact that, had I been giving a presentation while wearing what she wore, I’d be asking myself if my team mates were staring through my top or paying attention to what I was saying. Clearly, that wasn’t an issue for her and I admired her confidence.                    On the day she was leaving the company, I overheard a colleague commenting to his co-worker, “Oh, no. There goes the eye candy!”. They both chuckled as they strode off. Needless to say, I wasn’t happy when I heard this. Firstly, because I was disappointed by the sexist implication of such a comment. Secondly, because I wondered whether people had taken the work she did seriously or if they simply viewed her as ‘eye candy’. Though our office space is open plan, she worked in a different department from me so I am unable to comment on the quality of her work. I have a high expectation of my colleagues, be they male or female, and I hope that they would have valued her work regardless of what she wore.                    It may seem that I have an issue with women wearing revealing clothes, but this is not the case. I have my fair share of crop tops, miniskirts and fishnet tops. I appreciate the fact that it is a free world and women have the right to wear whatever makes them look good without being apprehensive about what others will think or say. However, I would never wear a miniskirt and crop top to my work place. Simply because I think it is unprofessional.                    One might think it has something to do with the fact that I work in a male dominated environment and I am worried that wearing overtly revealing clothing will undermine the work that I do amongst my peers. Granted, that is an issue which often comes to mind. But my primary code of practice is to dress smart to work and leave the revealing clothes for other social outings. Conversely, I would feel uncomfortable if I observed a male colleague wearing a pair of cycling shorts or a tank top to the office. Although such outfits might be appropriate for the track or for the beach, I don’t think it is appropriate wear for a corporate environment.                    I recognise that my upbringing had a part to play in my views on the subject because whenever I went to work for my mum during the summer holidays in high school, I observed that her all-female staff dressed smartly, but never in an overtly revealing manner.  Nevertheless, I genuinely believe that some of these things lend themselves more to common sense than a difference in upbringing. There are certain environments which require a certain dress code and out of respect for such etiquette, one should dress accordingly. For example, I feel comfortable wearing a bikini at the beach or at the swimming pool but I wouldn’t wear one to a funeral service. Would you?",

    "2018-03-01-marvels-black-panther": 
	{
      "content"	 : "                    Black Panther is the first Marvel Comics movie to be centred around an African superhero. There had been a lot of hype leading up to its premiere mainly because of its predominantly black cast and black director. In addition to these, it was filmed in South Africa, Zambia and Uganda amongst others. It was release in February which is celebrated as Black History Month in the USA. In fact, if you were black this was the movie to watch.                    I had never read any of the comics and therefore had never been familiar with the Black Panther character. Having enjoyed watching a few other Marvel movies, I was indeed curious to see how the movie would turn out. I was certainly drawn in by the hype; but how could this movie live up to such grand expectations? There was no need to worry. Not only did I thoroughly enjoy the movie, but I also went about urging family and friends to watch it too.                    In this article I present a few factors which reveal the faithfulness of Africa&#39;s representation in Black Panther.Language                    In southern Cameroon, there is an ethnic group called Fang Beti and they speak Fang which is common to other ethnic groups in neighbouring countries such as Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and so on. In Fang, if you want to say ‘We are going home’, you would say ‘Wah-Kuh-Andah’. This is certainly how I felt as I watched the movie and heard the word ‘Wakanda’ spoken out. Although Wakanda is a fictitious place, I was very impressed to hear the actors speaking Xhosa which is one of the official languages of South Africa. Though heavily accented, I could tell that the actors had practiced the language extremely well and I was glad that the directors had chosen not to go for a fictitious language.Costume                    The realistic nature of the costumes and jewellery used is a real credit to the movie’s production designer and costume designer. T’Challa is featured wearing a Kente scarf in one of the scenes taking place in Busan. This fabric is native to the Akan people of Ghana, West Africa. Zuri’s flowing robes, are known as Gandoura in northern and central Africa. Bright blue blankets worn by W’Kabi are native to Lesotho. The Isicholo hat worn by queen Ramonda is a Zulu headdress and Ndebele neck rings worn by the Dora Milaje are native to parts of South Africa and southern Zimbabwe. Such a variety really shows how much effort was made to bring Africa’s diverse culture under one roof.                    Women                    The women of Wakanda brought an especially warm feeling to my heart. From their natural hairstyles to their fierce nature, they truly did justice to the African woman. I could totally relate to Okoye’s shaved head and Nakia’s short hair, which I sported in secondary school and during school holidays respectively. The Dora Milaje army are also reminiscent of the Dahomey Amazons which were an all-female military regiment of up to 6000 warriors in the Kingdom of Dahomey, present-day Republic of Benin. Although it isn’t clear whether or not the Dora Milaje were modelled after the Dahomey Amazons, it is certainly refreshing to see black women portrayed as fierce and loyal as opposed to the angry black woman stereotype.Wealth                    Talking about stereotypes, it is common practice to see African countries portrayed as starving backward third-world countries led by incompetent dictators which need to be rescued by foreign aid from Europe and the USA. It is true that this is prevalent in some African countries. However, many others are extremely rich in natural resources and quite a few of them are run by great leaders. I was enthralled to see Wakanda being portrayed as a nation thriving off its natural resources and making great technological advancements under the watchful eye of a diligent king.Rituals                    The practice of ancestral worship and spirit animal rituals was common to most parts of Africa before the advent of the Europeans. In fact, to this day, it is still practiced by many ethnic groups. In Cameroon, for example, twenty per cent of the population practice various forms of ancestral worship which is passed down from generation to generation. The movie does a great job bringing this practice to life during T’Challa’s coronation ceremony. His spirit animal becomes the black panther when, after performing certain rituals, he is initiated as King of Wakanda and gains the ability to communicate with his ancestors in the world beyond. This is quite similar to the initiation of chiefs in to the Ekpe secret society which is active in Nigeria, Cameroon and Cuba. Ekpe, which is also known as Leopard, is a mysterious jungle spirit presiding over the society’s ceremonies. Its members are said to act as messengers of the ancestors.                    Humour                    Not only was the movie steeped in culture, but it was also well laced with humour. I couldn’t help thinking about village elders when the camera zoomed in on T’Challa’s sandal clad feet. Neither could I help thinking about my cousin who actually took her driving test without shoes, when Nakia was shown driving bare footed while in Busan. The funniest scene to me was the one where M’baku threatens to feed Everret to his children. It might seem odd that an African tribe is vegetarian because most Africans today, including myself, are meat lovers. As a matter of fact, I don’t think there is a single vegetarian restaurant in Cameroon. However, unbeknownst to many, there are quite a few African tribes which are largely vegetarian. For example, the Dinkas of Sudan eat lots of grain and sea food while the Kikuyus of Kenya eat lots of grain, tubers and insects.                    ConclusionAll in all, the movie did a great job of representing the diversity of the African continent and presenting positive role models for future generations. Hopefully this movie will only be the beginning of many more of such to come.                    ",

      "content"	 : "This book is indeed an emotional rollercoaster. Prepare yourself for the ride of a lifetime.It is the story of Will. A rich, entitled bachelor who becomes a quadriplegic after getting hit by a motorcyclist. He sustains a spinal injury from the accident which causes him to be paralysed and confined to a wheelchair. As a result of this, he lost the zeal to live and he is determined to end his life on his own terms.Then there’s Camilla, his mother. Another rich, aloof and cold individual who loves her son desperately but for the life of her can’t seem to communicate this effectively. Though devastated by Will’s accident, she is determined to do everything in her power to keep him alive and well.This is where Lou comes in. Invisible, unassuming Lou. She’s employed by Camilla to be Will’s secondary carer. What she doesn’t know as she takes on this job is that she is part of an elaborate plan (Camilla’s plan) to prevent Will from ending his own life. What she thought would be a boring menial job turned out to be much more intricate than she could have imagined.If you’re worried about the fact that the two main protagonists are a man and a woman, let me reassure you that this is not a romance novel. The main premise of this book is assisted suicide and the author does a very good job of presenting the case from different viewpoints in an unbiased way.The characters develop progressively in such a way that the reader can easily relate to each of them. The reader also gets a glance into the life of a quadriplegic, and I must say this is one of the most affecting aspects of the book, apart from the obvious.After reading this book I developed a new found respect for people who are confined to wheelchairs. Generally, we tend to acknowledge the fact that their lives are more difficult than ours but many of us don’t actually realise to what extent it is. No matter what your opinion is on the premise of the book, I say give it a read anyway. I wasn’t disappointed, and I’m guessing you won’t be either.",

      "content"	 : "                    As someone with relaxed (permed / texturised) hair, have you ever thought about going natural? Or have you ever wondered why others may have decided to take that path? Well, I hope the piece below inspires you.                    I wrote this poem some time ago while reflecting on the reasons why I had decided to cut my hair in January last year. Before deciding to go natural my hair was relaxed and about 13 inches long so it was really a big deal.                    I worried about length and whether I could ever grow it back as long as before. Well I&#39;m glad I took the plunge. It&#39;s been a year and a half and my hair is already 7 inches long (stretched). In addition to that I have so much volume which I could never have achieved before. You&#39;re welcome to read up and pass it on.                    Today I decided to cut my hairI&#39;ll explain why I made this decisionThere was an underlying pang of fearIt&#39;s gone. I must bring this plan to fruitionAt birth, my hair was thick and black and woolSo tough to comb. It was hard to manageI always thought it was too much troubleMum relaxed it when I had come of ageNow I blended right in just like a dollHair straight, pressed flat. So limp and so lifelessYou won&#39;t spot me in a crowd, large or smallEasy to see I&#39;d lost my uniquenessToday I am leaving the doll factoryMy hair stands out.

      "content"	 : "                    In the wake of NHS reforms and such there was an article some time last year about the famous neurosurgeon Dr Henry Marsh and his opinion of the prime minister&#39;s NHS policy. Needless to say it wasn&#39;t a very high opinion. Essentially, he accused the prime minister of having no vision and warned that this might lead to a permanent revolution of the NHS. Well, from his mouth to God&#39;s ears, we have all witnessed the NHS in turmoil over the course of the year. The article also quoted that the prime minister had been moved to tears after reading a memoir published by Mr Marsh the previous year. This memoir is titled ‘Do No Harm: Stories of Life, Death and Brain Surgery’                                    This book is an account of his life as a neurosurgeon in a busy and modern hospital in London. I usually don’t enjoy reading real life stories because I feel like there usually isn’t enough escapism to allow me to get lost in the story. So this book is in fact one of its kind in my collection of novels. And boy, am I glad I bought it! The book definitely lived up to the hype. If you’re thinking ‘Oh no, this is going to be like Grey’s Anatomy right?’, I’ll have to say ‘wrong!’. Go read it. It is five star rated on the popular online retailer with over a thousand reviews and you won’t be disappointed. You’ll be turning the pages like you wouldn’t believe it.                    The book offers incredible insight into the life of a neurosurgeon and exposes the, sometimes unrealistic, expectations that patients have of their surgeons. For example, patients usually think doctors know absolutely everything about their condition as if having total understanding of the disease will give them total control of the situation. Obviously this is never the case. No matter how skilled or distinguished a surgeon is, he or she won’t be able to foresee certain things. For example, that an aneurysm applicator will malfunction during surgery and cause irreparable damage.                    There’s also a little reflection on the pre-modern NHS where medics didn’t count their hours but just went on with the job at hand. However now, a patient who has been starved for 6 hours in preparation for surgery might end up not having the surgery on that day because the surgeon in question had already clocked in their daily quota of hours. Meaning that, said patient will have to go through the same ordeal the next day. It makes you wonder where all the money we keep pouring into the NHS is going. Oh yeah, that’s right. Maybe it is going to the thousands of Pounds worth of single use equipment which is disposed of after every surgery. Or maybe it is going to the incessant red tape and over-governance which has been introduced by the government.                    A most surprising and unexpected factor that was covered in this book, from the neurosurgeon’s perspective, is thee different ways in which atheists and Christians react to the death of a loved one. Despite its action packed pages full of drama and intrigue, this book definitely taught me; my problems are so small compared to what most people are going through day by day. I cannot imagine suffering excruciating pain on one side of my face similar to having a hot knife pushed into my face, neither can I imagine becoming suicidal because I have OCD and can’t stop washing my hands. These prospects may seem ludicrous but it is the everyday reality for certain people.                    A caveat emptor though, if you are very squeamish this might not be the book for you. In certain places he goes into gory details such as pulling someone’s scalp over their forehead and folding it over their face or plastic bags full of severed human hands in various stages of dissection.",

	{
      "content"	 : "Today Christians around the world are celebrating the ascension of Jesus Christ into heaven. This event is said to have taken place forty days after He rose from the dead and is therefore celebrated on the fortieth day of Easter.Indeed, it seems like it was only yesterday that I was munching on ‘dodo’ (fried plantains) and fish at my aunty Irene’s. So in the spirit of ‘Throwback Thursdays’ why don’t I bring it all back to mind before getting to the heart of the matter. We had green pitted olives for the appetizer, scrumptious carrot, cabbage and apple salad as a starter and a selection of chocolates and liqueurs for dessert. Now on to the mains: slow roasted leg of lamb with a hint of basil and mint, Jollof rice and fried plantains as well as oven grilled sea bream.I don’t think I would have given that up to feed the five thousand!The mysteries of the resurrection and ascension are fascinating to say the least and although these events have a lot of religious and spiritual significance, I would like to approach them from a modern day perspective. I’m not talking about people like Mr. Quiboloy from the Philippines who claims to be the ‘Son of God’ while taking money from millions of poor people in order to fund his ministry. Neither am I talking about any renown preacher, minister or priest for that matter. I’m talking about an almost invisible person from your neighbourhood who suddenly becomes the talk of the town.Take for example a park in your neighbourhood where people tend to hangout. Each time you go for a walk, you notice a small group of people – say less than ten – gathered around a woman who is narrating a story of some kind. One day your curiosity gets the better of you, so you decide to stop and see for yourself what is going on. After a few inquiries you are told that this person is a gifted storyteller and orator and apparently has a knack for predicting what will be the exact outcome of any situation that you may be unsure about in your life.Naturally you are skeptical about these rumours but also a little bit curious because after listening to one of her narratives, you admit to yourself that she is indeed very gifted. As you are about to leave, you hear one of the men in the group asking for the outcome of a certain doctor’s appointment, to discuss the meaning of some x-ray results which were taken a few weeks ago, following a bout of chronic coughing. Now you’re thinking to yourself that the man probably just has some kind of chest infection but you realise that he is a neighbour of yours so you decide to stick around and listen to what the prediction will be.The woman’s prediction is that the x-rays will show some sort of inoperable lung tumour and that he will die by the end of the week. Some of the other people gathered around the woman begin to panic and are worried about him but you just laugh this off and tell him that he’ll be fine. The woman responds by saying that he’ll be more than fine because on the day of his funeral, he will rise from his coffin and float into the skies to the place where he truly belongs. At this point everyone is laughing hysterically because they all assume that she’s joking. You simply think she’s gone bonkers.Sure enough as the week goes by, the prediction comes to pass. Resulting in a media uproar that leaves the masses in utter disbelief.One can only imagine the conspiracy theories being used in order to disprove what happened. This will definitely be a case of seeing is not believing as even those who were at the funeral will accuse their eyes of betraying them. Those who prepared the body for burial will probably swear that the morgue drawers had an uncanny resemblance to incubators. What about you? Were you not there when the prediction was made? Did you not laugh it off as the rantings of a mad woman? Yet you don’t believe what’s going on.What’s going through your mind? The man had never been a popular person, in fact you didn’t know him well enough. Now you’re wondering if he was some sort of genius who was not only able to fake his own death but who was rich enough or resourceful enough to acquire an incredibly tiny, silent, powerful jetpack which he used to launch himself into the clouds. But then if he masterminded all of it, did this imply that the storyteller was in on it as well? What about the doctor’s diagnosis? Surely he can’t just stay in the sky for good, right? Where did he go off to? Is there going to be some quest for his missing body? And the questions go on and on.Obviously none of the people who witnessed these events are satisfied by what their eyes have seen. They’re all looking for an alternative explanation. A loophole, maybe. The point being that with such a myriad of scientific discoveries and advances in technology we tend not to trust our own senses as we might otherwise. Some might say that the people whom Jesus appeared to after He rose from the dead and those who witnessed His ascension were more susceptible to believe because they didn’t have access to all these modern day tools which could have enabled them to question the events at hand. So they were probably at the disadvantage for lack of these. On the flip side one could say that ‘enlightened’ as we may be, we have been robbed of our sense of wonder and awe; making us more cynical and less attuned to what our intuition tells us.I think the latter rings truer that the former. As William Wordsworth once wrote1: ‘Little we see in nature that is ours; … For this, for everything, we are out of tune; … It moves us not – Great God!’1Barber, L. (2008).

	{
      "content"	 : "When I saw an article on The Telegraph about Beyoncé in a new music video with Coldplay and Sonam Kapoor, it got me thinking about something I had witnessed in Cameroon. When I went back to Cameroon last year for the Christmas holidays I noticed a lot of women wearing sarees and churidars. My immediate reaction (in my head of course) was ‘hmm na so Indian dem di cam take over pays, anyhow ie fine. Na wa own diversity be this’. Then one day I came across a group of women, still in Cameroon, gossiping about some Indian guy and ‘that their mop dem way di so so smell like garlic’. This really pissed me off and I couldn&#39;t understand why some of us Cameroonians think it is fashionable to wear sarees while stereotyping Indians for having bad breath. Upon reading this article on The Telegraph it then occurred to me that this was an example of cultural appropriation. So what is cultural appropriation and why do we keep going on about it?I noticed that there are many examples in the west of white stars adopting certain aspects of black culture as cool and fashionable while failing to speak out on critical issues of white on black racism. Or everyday Britons wanting to go eat some authentic Caribbean food while making sure that the restaurant in question is not in a ‘shady’ neighbourhood. Obviously there&#39;s nothing wrong with a white person wanting to enjoy proper jerk chicken or having their hair done in cornrows. But what does it say about that person if they don&#39;t want to go to or be seen in a neighbourhood which has predominantly black people in it; or if they go ahead and call black women ‘nappy headed hoes’?Let&#39;s go ahead and consider these two examples: One, a teenage girl born to a Native American chief is kidnapped and forced to marry an Englishman. She is then taken to England and used as an icon to encourage the oppression of Native Americans by the English. Two, another teenage girl born to German Jews. Went into hiding with her family due to Hitler&#39;s oppression of Jews and wrote a diary that eventually became one of the most widely read books of our time.Now these two young women have had deeply traumatic lives. However Walt Disney has warped and romanticised the story of pocahontas into a money making fairytale with a happy ending. Can we imagine what would happen if the same was done with Anne Frank&#39;s story, maybe depicting her as some Jewish girl who eloped and lived happily ever after with a Nazi officer?Question is, where do we draw the line between cultural appreciation and appropriation? When does it become offensive for someone to adopt aspects of a culture that isn&#39;t theirs?",

      "content"	 : "The first book i read from this author was &#39;Half of a Yellow Sun&#39; and I absolutely loved it.Unlike Half of a Yellow Sun, Chimamanda&#39;s Americanah is actually a love story. I was engrossed from the start with the story of Ifemelu&#39;s life in America and what she was ready to leave behind when she decided to move back to Nigeria. Most of us being in her shoes wouldn&#39;t have the courage to give up all that. I was so caught up in her love story with Obinze and their blind conviction that they would make it work when she moved to America. They had a plan and it would work! Well, haven&#39;t we all been there?What makes this book special is the fact that it doesn&#39;t only concentrate on the two protagonists. There are other characters whose stories have been well developed and provide a deeper context with which to draw in the reader. It also gives a near-accurate description of the way race is perceived by most people in Nigeria, UK and USA.I really loved Obinze&#39;s character and how he ironically got married to a woman whose qualities matched those of a girl he had previously refused to date back in high school. However the story of his life abroad almost brought tears to my eyes. It was heartbreaking and yet reflects how so many people struggle when they travel abroad to find a better life.I was also intrigued by how Ifemelu dealt with race-related issues when she was abroad. She seemed so vocal at times, speaking her mind without restraint. However in other occasions she just holds back and decides to keep quiet about things that she clearly finds offensive.Overall this book was wonderful and endearing. I would highly recommend.",

	{
      "content"	 : "Just rediscovered this book by Chinua Achebe and it really struck a chord. I had actually read the simplified edition when I was younger and recently came across a really negative review of the book on goodreads. This review prompted me to read the book again just to see things from the reviewer&#39;s point of view and I must say it felt like we both read two completely different books.The story of Okonkwo the great warrior and how he fell from grace is such a compelling tragedy. In part one Achebe does a really good job of portraying the nature and practices of the Igbo tribes. Personally their practices seemed really extreme but I like the fact that he neither showers them with praise nor criticism. He simply states them as they are.It is clear that Okonkwo has a lot of daddy issues. As a result he is very determined not to allow his father&#39;s short comings to ruin his life. Unfortunately arrogance is another vice that contributes greatly to his downfall. I especially like the parable of the tortoise attending a party in the sky which teaches a very good lesson about inter-personal relationships.Things really begin to fall apart when the British missionaries come to spread the gospel in the surrounding villages. I believe that if the foreigners had stopped at spreading the word a lot of the ensuing conflict could have been averted. Unfortunately this was one of the ploys of colonialism / imperialism in which they used their religion to gain ground and confidence within the tribes and then started imposing their statutes and governance on the local people.The fact that some of the clans men weren&#39;t united to a common cause also contributed to their downfall. This can be seen in the situation where the court messengers (local people working for the white people) disrespected their own elders who where held in custody and collected bribes from the villagers in addition to the initial fine required to release the elders.This was a very dramatic book. Go read it if you haven&#39;t already.",
