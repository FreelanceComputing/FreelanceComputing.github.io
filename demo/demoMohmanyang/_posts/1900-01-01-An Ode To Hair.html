<div id="post-excerpt">
                    <p  class="paragraph">As someone with relaxed (permed / texturised) hair, have you ever thought about going natural? Or have you ever wondered why others may have decided to take that path? Well, I hope the piece below inspires you.</p>
</div><!--excerpt-->
                    <p class="paragraph">I wrote this poem some time ago while reflecting on the reasons why I had decided to cut my hair in January last year. Before deciding to go natural my hair was relaxed and about 13 inches long so it was really a big deal.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">I worried about length and whether I could ever grow it back as long as before. Well I'm glad I took the plunge. It's been a year and a half and my hair is already 7 inches long (stretched). In addition to that I have so much volume which I could never have achieved before. You're welcome to read up and pass it on.</p>
										
                    <blockquote class="reduced-blockquote">
						<p>Today I decided to cut my hair</p>
						<p>I'll explain why I made this decision</p>
						<p>There was an underlying pang of fear</p>
						<p>It's gone. I must bring this plan to fruition</p>
						<p>At birth, my hair was thick and black and wool</p>
						<p>So tough to comb. It was hard to manage</p>
						<p>I always thought it was too much trouble</p>
						<p>Mum relaxed it when I had come of age</p>
						<p>Now I blended right in just like a doll</p>
						<p>Hair straight, pressed flat. So limp and so lifeless</p>
						<p>You won't spot me in a crowd, large or small</p>
						<p>Easy to see I'd lost my uniqueness</p>
						<p>Today I am leaving the doll factory</p>
						<p>My hair stands out. It tells its own story</p>
						<p></p>
