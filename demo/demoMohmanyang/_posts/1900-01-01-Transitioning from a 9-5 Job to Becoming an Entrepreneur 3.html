<div id="post-excerpt">
                    <p  class="paragraph">Ever wondered why some people seem to have more than 24 hours in a day? They are simply good stewards of time. They utilise every spare minute of their day to do something productive. One way to achieve this is to have a daily schedule. As explained in <a href="{{site.url}}/2018/09/24/Transitioning-from-a-9-5-Job-to-Becoming-an-Entrepreneur-2.html">part 2</a> of this series, my system relies on scheduling whatever time I get outside of work. At the end of this series I will share my personal schedule.</p>
</div><!--excerpt-->
                    <p class="paragraph">For now, we shall be working with an alternative schedule based on the one-hour train commute presented in <a href="{{site.url}}/2018/09/24/Transitioning-from-a-9-5-Job-to-Becoming-an-Entrepreneur-2.html">part 2</a>.</p>
					
					<style scoped>  .each-step:before{ content: "."; line-height: 0.5;} </style>

					<ol class="section-list">
						<li class="each-step">6:00 am – 6:30 am. Rise and shine.</li>
						<li class="each-step">6:30 am – 7:30 am. House chores. Social media.</li>
						<li class="each-step">7:30 am – 8:00 am. Shower and get dressed for work.</li>
						<li class="each-step">8:00 am – 9:00 am. Commute to work. Breakfast on-the-go.</li>
						<li class="each-step">5:00 pm – 6:00 pm. Commute from work.</li>
						<li class="each-step">6:00 pm – 7:00 pm. Feed the body.</li>
						<li class="each-step">7:00 pm – 8:00 pm. Recreation time.</li>
						<li class="each-step">8:00 pm – 10:00pm. Personal project.</li>
						<li class="each-step">10:00pm – 10:30 pm. Daily appraisal.</li>
						<li class="each-step">10:30pm. Sleep tight.</li>
					</ol>

                    <p class="paragraph">Based on the above schedule, there are at least 4 hours every day which can be used to work on your own project. This sums up to a whopping 20 hours a week – based on a five-day work week and excluding weekends. In my case, the numbers are only slightly higher due to my almost non-existent commute. Before addressing the rest of the schedule, I’d like to draw your attention to the following three activities: rise and shine, personal project and daily appraisal. No matter how you tailor the schedule to suit you, ensure that you make adequate time for each of these.</p>					
					
					<p class="paragraph">6:00 am – 6:30 am. As a Christian, I use this time to pray and listen to a podcast where a priest celebrates the Mass daily. Making use of this time is not exclusive to those who pray. The purpose is to clear your mind and prepare yourself for the day ahead. This can involve meditation or simply going out for a walk. Immediately when you wake up, avoid checking emails or social media and go straight into your alone time. getting alone time can be even trickier for people living as a couple or with kids. But try to schedule this alone time before you get started on your daily activities.</p>
					
					<p class="paragraph">6:30 am – 7:30 am. This slot is very flexible. However, I recommend doing chores such as making your bed, tidying your house, and so on – leaving you free to do more important things in the evening. During this time, feel free to check and update your social media accounts i.e. once you’ve given your alone time its due.</p>
					
                    <p class="paragraph">8:00 am – 9:00 am and 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm. Use your commute to and from work to check emails, make phone calls, brainstorm, develop ideas and do market research pertaining to your personal projects. Do not check work emails as you’ll have plenty of time between 9:00 am and 5:00 pm to do so. Dedicate this time to building your own business.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">8:00 pm – 10:00pm. Dedicate this time purely to working on your own project, be it writing a book or building an e-commerce venture or developing an App or whatever it is that you are working towards. Two hours of uninterrupted time in the evenings is ideal for this.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">10:00pm – 10:30 pm. During this time, take stock of your day. This can be as simple as asking questions like: ‘what have I achieved today?’, ‘what do I need to accomplish tomorrow?’, etc. This process is very important because it puts things into perspective. It helps you to see more clearly whether you are biting off way more than you can chew or not biting enough. Use this time to plan project-related activities for the next day. For example, write down a list of people to email and call, points to research during your commute, tasks to accomplish in the evening, and so on. In this way you will spend more of the following day getting stuff done rather than planning what needs to be done.</p>
