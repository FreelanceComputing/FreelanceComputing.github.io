<div id="post-excerpt">
                    <p  class="paragraph">The most important requirement for getting the best out of this system is living as close to work as possible. Since it relies on scheduling whatever time you get outside of work, it is important to bring your commute down to a minimum.</p>
</div><!--excerpt-->
                    <p class="paragraph">My own commute is a mere 10 minutes; I recognise that this is a luxury which most people cannot afford, but I would encourage you to live not more than 45 minutes away from your work-place if possible. If you can afford to spend slightly more on your accommodation so that you can live closer to work, then consider it an investment for the future. After all, once you become fully autonomous, you can live anywhere you wish.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">If you are unable to cut down on your commute, one approach is to ditch driving to work and use public transport. You can then spend that transit time working on your own projects. For example, a one-hour commute might involve walking ten minutes to the train station near your home, spending forty-five minutes on the train, and then walking another five minutes to the office. It is clear from this example that an hour and a half each day can be spent constructively while in transit. In the event where driving to work is indispensable, you can make better use of your commute by doing something productive like listening to podcasts or learning a language while driving.</p>					
					
                    <p class="paragraph">The next requirement is discipline. Even if you come up with a system that works perfectly for you, you need to be disciplined enough to stick with it. You also need to be disciplined with your recreational activities. This may involve rearranging your other commitments such as hanging out at the pub with friends or catching up on your favourite TV show or playing video games etc.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The final prerequisite is a monthly calendar. The calendar should ideally be a physical one which can be hung on your bedroom wall or on your fridge or somewhere prominent within your home where you can easily see it. Each page of the calendar should cover an entire month with the days laid out on a grid. The purpose of this is to help you form a habit. Each day that you stick to your schedule to the letter, you should mark a cross on the calendar. The more crosses you see on the calendar as you walk past it, the more incentive you will have to keep following the schedule. You can get rid of the calendar after you have successfully followed the schedule for two consecutive months. Of course, this will only work if you are completely honest with yourself.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">Another thing that can help is sharing your schedule with a close friend or family member. You can ask them to check on you occasionally to find out if you’re on the right track.</p>
