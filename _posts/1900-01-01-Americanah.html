<div id="post-excerpt">
<p class="paragraph">The first book i read from this author was <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/576650.Half_of_a_Yellow_Sun">'Half of a Yellow Sun'</a> and I absolutely loved it.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Unlike Half of a Yellow Sun, Chimamanda's Americanah is actually a love story. I was engrossed from the start with the story of Ifemelu's life in America and what she was ready to leave behind when she decided to move back to Nigeria. Most of us being in her shoes wouldn't have the courage to give up all that. I was so caught up in her love story with Obinze and their blind conviction that they would make it work when she moved to America. They had a plan and it would work! Well, haven't we all been there?</p>

<p class="paragraph">What makes this book special is the fact that it doesn't only concentrate on the two protagonists. There are other characters whose stories have been well developed and provide a deeper context with which to draw in the reader. It also gives a near-accurate description of the way race is perceived by most people in Nigeria, UK and USA.</p>
										
<p class="paragraph">I really loved Obinze's character and how he ironically got married to a woman whose qualities matched those of a girl he had previously refused to date back in high school. However the story of his life abroad almost brought tears to my eyes. It was heartbreaking and yet reflects how so many people struggle when they travel abroad to find a better life.</p>
<p class="paragraph">I was also intrigued by how Ifemelu dealt with race-related issues when she was abroad. She seemed so vocal at times, speaking her mind without restraint. However in other occasions she just holds back and decides to keep quiet about things that she clearly finds offensive.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Overall this book was wonderful and endearing. I would highly recommend.</p>
