<div id="post-excerpt">
                    <p  class="paragraph">In this series, I will be sharing a system which I have developed to help me transition to a point where I can become fully self-employed. I am nowhere near that point yet, but it is a work in progress which I suspect will take a few years.</p>
</div><!--excerpt-->
                    <p class="paragraph">From a very young age, running my own business has always appealed to me more than working for someone else. This inclination most likely stems from the fact that both of my parents are entrepreneurs. Having spent a few years working for a company, it has quickly become apparent that this isn’t for me. This has incited a frantic search for information on how to become a successful entrepreneur. One recurring theme was having to quit your 9-5 job in order to dedicate more time to your business. In my case, I neither have a viable business idea nor enough money saved up to warrant taking such a risk. But this hasn’t discouraged me.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">I am naturally industrious, and I believe that I have what it takes to excel as an entrepreneur. One key quality required to be successfully self-employed is ‘grit’. That is, a <b>perseverance of effort</b> combined with a <b>strong determination</b> to overcome the challenges that you will face as you try to achieve whatever you are <b>passionate</b> about. Let’s break these down.</p>
					
					<ol class="section-list">
						<li class="each-step">Perseverance of effort: that is, continuous attempts to achieve something despite difficulties</li>
						<li class="each-step">Strong determination: a resolute intention to achieve a desired goal</li>
						<li class="each-step">Passion: an intense feeling toward something, someone or even an idea or a concept</li>
					</ol>

                    <p class="paragraph">Ask yourself if you possess these qualities; based on my research, it will give you a clue as to whether you are cut out for the entrepreneurial way of life. Even if you can’t relate to this or are unwilling to become self-employed, hopefully this series can still help you develop a side-hustle which may then flourish into a secondary source of income.</p>
					
					<p class="paragraph">Here’s what I’ve achieved since I started on this journey: I successfully developed my very first mobile app and I’ve started developing a second one. I’ve designed 2 websites, written 24 articles and poems, 5 of which have been published in magazines, ran my first ever pop-up shop with a 72 per cent profit margin and I’m currently running a second shop. In less than a year of following this system, I have made roughly £1000 on the side and I am positive that in a few more years this figure will grow to a point where I can become self-sufficient.</p>

In <a href="{{site.url}}/2018/10/02/Transitioning-from-a-9-5-Job-to-Becoming-an-Entrepreneur-3.html">part 3</a>, I shall lay out my system and how it can be modified to suit you. In the final part of this series, I will address potential pitfalls that you may come across and how to get around them.</p>
