<blockquote class="reduced-blockquote">
    <p>And if both worlds came together,</p>
    <p>That of the living,</p>
    <p>And that of the dead,</p>
    <p>Then you could visit sometime â€“ </p>
    <p>Just for the briefest of moments.</p>
    <p>And I would feel the press of your palm,</p>
    <p>Soft against my cheek.</p>
    <p>And draw comfort</p>
    <p>That this world cannot give.</p>
    
    <p></p>
