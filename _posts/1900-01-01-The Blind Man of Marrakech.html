<blockquote class="reduced-blockquote">
    <p>Sitting down</p>
    <p>In the shade of an orange tree</p>
    <p>With the mosque to his right</p>
    <p>and the park to his left, </p>
    <p>He takes in the sounds and smells of the square</p>
    <p>And revels in the flutter of</p>
    <p>An orange blossom</p>
    <p>On his balding head,</p>
    <p>As he sips the last of his mint tea.</p>
	<p>Rising from the bench, </p>
	<p>He protects his head </p>
	<p>With the hood of his Djellaba</p>
	<p>As he makes his way towards the junction.</p>
	<p>Reaching a set of traffic lights,</p>
	<p>He leans on his walking stick â€“  </p>
	<p>Waiting for one of the passers-by to notice him.</p>
	<p>They pass,</p>
	<p>One by one,</p>
	<p>To his left,</p>
	<p>Then to his right.</p>
	<p>The lady with the chirpy voice,</p>
	<p>Speaking to her friend on the phone,</p>
	<p>Waiting to cross when the lights go red.</p>
	<p>Has she noticed him?</p>
	<p>If only she did!</p>
	<p>Then he would tell her </p>
	<p>About the lies </p>
	<p>Sprouting from her friend's mouth.</p>
	<p>The lights change.</p>
	<p>The lady crosses.</p>
	<p>The blind man waits.</p>
	<p>The young couple giggling </p>
	<p>In that haze of newfound love.</p>
	<p>Have they noticed him?</p>
	<p>If only they did!</p>
	<p>Then he would tell them </p>
	<p>About the girl's husband,</p>
	<p>Lying in wait by the market square.</p>
	<p>The lights change.</p>
	<p>The couple crosses.</p>
	<p>The blind man waits.</p>
	<p>A young man approaches him.</p>
	<p>"Sir, may I help you cross?"</p>
	<p>He nods and lets the boy take hold of his free arm.</p>
	<p>Together they make slow progress</p> 
	<p>Across the crowded junction.</p>
	<p>As they approach the other side,</p>
	<p>He tells the young man not to worry.</p>
	<p>His daughter will not die.</p>
	<p>She will live a long and healthy life.</p>
