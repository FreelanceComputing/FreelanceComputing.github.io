<blockquote class="reduced-blockquote">
    <p>Everyone is dying,</p>
    <p>But this earth is left for the wicked like us;</p>
    <p>That we may live to suffer the loss of the angels who have gone before us.</p>
    <p>O, that we shall meet again someday,</p>
    <p>In the sweet, by and by –</p>
    <p>After we have been cleansed</p>
    <p>And made worthy to enter that pristine paradise.</p>
    <p>O, that such a day may hasten upon us</p>
    <p>And cut short our agony on this hell called earth –</p>
	<p>That our souls may forever be lifted</p>
	<p>In sublime ecstasy, by the eternal bliss</p>
	<p>That comes from re-joining those who have gone before us.</p>
	<p>O, may I be prepared when that day comes.</p>
	<p>O, may I be prepared.</p>
    
    <p></p>
